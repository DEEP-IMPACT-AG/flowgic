# Introduction


**`flowgic` is a tiny formal grammar to describe the internal logic flow of controller-fns.**

    [ch.deepimpact/flowgic "0.1.0"]

###Controller-fns
Controller-fns are those that play a *Controller Role*, managing different services, inputs, outputs, steps, rules and decisions. In other words they have to manage a lot of knowledge thus they're really complex 

On the contrary, `flowgic` tries to bring the clarity of **[flow diagramms](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731829/10277888/8a5bf848-6b59-11e5-96de-1b67fab4981b.png)** to these 'controller-fns'. 

Summarising, `flowgic` is a coding style proposal (like a *DSL*) to better express the logical flow of these controller-fns. 


###Goals

* the code becomes clearer :)
* the code is so clear that task's communication between devs and clients or project managers is improved :)
* `flowgic` code can be easily parsed and analysed to generate dynamic [flow diagrams](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731829/10277888/8a5bf848-6b59-11e5-96de-1b67fab4981b.png)
* you can derive from flowgic code wich parts/fns need to be tested from the others that dont' need (usually you have to focus on actions instead of flow rules)
* is easy to add any middleware due as you always work with fns 


### this lib can be useful if...  
* your logic flow is a [complex and nested one](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731829/10277888/8a5bf848-6b59-11e5-96de-1b67fab4981b.png)
* your controller-fns are tricky to understand, even by the author after a few days [example](https://gist.github.com/tangrammer/b8fc6687f051ab059ac2#file-old_api-clj)
* your fns receive a map and return a map. Of course you could always adapt your *controller-fns* to this great pattern => [Prismatic/fnk](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing#fnk) 

#Let's dive into `flowgic`!

## Main protocol: core/Evaluation

```clojure
(defprotocol Evaluation
  (evaluate [this  context]))
```

As you can see, any `core/Evaluation` can be evaluated with a context. The **`context` is a clojure map.**


##The `flowgic` impls and fns
Flowgic comes with a bunch of Evaluation impls and fns constructors. So each one can be evaluated with a context but the result will depend of each impl

### core/Continuation => flowgic/continue
The typical box that **represents an action-fn**. Always between 2 entities    

<img width="150"  src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731829/10295406/d13a0cb6-6bc0-11e5-83eb-49eb65a4e95c.png">   

3 ways to get a core/Continuation 

* if you don't need to select anything of the result or add any static data to the result
 * `(flowgit/continue action-fn result-keys)`
* if you need to select some values from the result
 * `(flowgit/continue action-fn result-keys)`
* if you need to select some values and add some others
 * `(flowgit/continue action-fn result-keys flags)` 



```clojure
  (def step (flowgic/continue (fn [map] {:res "A"})))            

  (def step1 (flowgic/continue (fn [map] {:res1 "B"}) [:res1])) 
  
  (def step2 (flowgic/continue (fn [map] {:res1 "B"}) [:res1] {:step2 true}))
                                  
```

Now let's evaluate the Continuation 

```clojure
(= [:continue {}] (flowgic/evaluate step {}))
(= [:continue {:res1 "1"}] (flowgic/evaluate step1 {}))
(= [:continue {:res2 "2" :step2 true}] (flowgic/evaluate step2 {}))

```

##  core/Return => flowgic/exit
Return is the break circuit in a flow. Similar to exception but just sending data to the end.

```clojure  
(def step-exit (flowgic/exit (fn [map] {:res "EXIT"})))
(= [:exit {:res "EXIT"}] (flowgic/evaluate step-exit {}))              
```


### Continuation Seqs, Steps, Pipeline => [ ]
<img width="50" alt="screen shot 2015-10-06 at 01 00 13" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731829/10296077/b1a162f0-6bc5-11e5-9d33-9a8a40aaa15a.png">

Chaining Continuations is the same as putting theme in a vector. Of course, you can evaluate pipelines too!


```clojure  
(def steps [step step1])

(= [:continue {:initial-data "hello", :res1 "1", :res2 "2", :step2 true}]
   (flowgic/evaluate steps {:initial-data "hello"}))   
```
As you can see we always get the initial-context merged with all actions selections. And the evaluation is ordered based in vector position 

TODO: hightlight that the context is merged/updated in each Continuation


##TODO
explain following types (flowgit/Evaluation impls)

* core/Rule
 * flowgic/true?
 * flowgic/>true?
 * flowgic/>false?
 * flowgic/emtpy?
 * flowgic/>emtpy?
 * flowgic/>not-emtpy?

more   
   
* core/Merge => flowgic/merge
* core/APIFn => flowgic/api

and more

* flowgic/just


##More things interesting


###fn & DI
`flowgic` is really very influenced by [Prismatic/graph](link) and its Dependency Injection at the *function&args* level


yep, `flowgic` remains a bit similar to [pipeline programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software))
